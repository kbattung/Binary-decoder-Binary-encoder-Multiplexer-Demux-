# Section 6.2: Encoders

## Overview

An encoder is a system that has a greater number of inputs than outputs. A comressed output code is produced based onwhich input(s) lines are asserted.

## Outcomes

Design an encoder circuit using both the classical digital design approach and the modern HDL-based approach.
