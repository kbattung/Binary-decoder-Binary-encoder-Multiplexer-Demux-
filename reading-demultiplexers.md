morea_summary: "A demultiplexer works in a complementary fashion to a multiplexer. A demultiplexer has one input that is routed to one of its multiple outputs. The output that is active is dictated by a select input. A demux has n select lines that chooses to route the input to one of its 2n outputs. When an output is not selected, it outputs a logic 0."
