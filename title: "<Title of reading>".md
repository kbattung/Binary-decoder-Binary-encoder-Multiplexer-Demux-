HDL-based approach.

morea_summary: "A decoder is a circuit that takes in a binary code and has outputs that are asserted for specific values
of that code. The code can be of any type or size (e.g., unsigned, twoâ€™s complement, etc.). Each output
will assert for only specific input codes. Since combinational logic circuits only produce a single output,
this means that within a decoder, there will be a separate combinational logic circuit for each output."
