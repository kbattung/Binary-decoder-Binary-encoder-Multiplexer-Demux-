morea_summary: A multiplexer is a system that has one output
and multiple inputs. At any given time, one and
only one input is routed to the output based on
the value on a set of select lines. For n select
lines, a multiplexer can support 2n
inputs.

# Section 6.3: Multiplexers

## Overview

A multiplexer is a system that has one output
and multiple inputs. At any given time, one and
only one input is routed to the output based on
the value on a set of select lines. For n select
lines, a multiplexer can support 2n
inputs.

## Outcomes

Design a multiplexer circuit using both the classical digital design approach and the modern HDL-based approach.
